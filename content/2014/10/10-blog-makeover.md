Summary: It's taken awhile, but I've finally got this blog working.

Pelican was fun to learn, with fairly decent documentation... but some of the "how do I do this" articles were really lacking in details, or just out-of-date.

I really wanted to get the blog restyled, and Disqus comments enabled, and some date-based organization for posts... so I spent this Friday evening doing just
that and wandering not-too-far down some rabbit holes before coming up with this passable blog.

And since this is a blog, I should really write about how I did that.  I'll save that for future blog posts.
